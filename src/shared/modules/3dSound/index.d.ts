	 *
	 *   - `CFrame`: The position and orientation of the attachment in 3D space.
	 *   - `Vector3`: A specific point in 3D space.

	 *   false. If false, the attachment will be automatically destroyed once
	 *   the sound finishes playing.
	 * @returns An object containing the `Sound` instance and the `Attachment`.
	 *
	 *   - `Sound`: The sound instance that has been created.
	 *   - `Attachment`: The created attachment object.
